# Belief Aversion Training: A Method For Changing Your Beliefs

Our beliefs are our lens for interpreting experience. Most of the time, we react automatically to thoughts and external stimuli according to our beliefs. We may rationally oppose the reaction, but our beliefs are much more influential over us than our logic. It is what we feel about something that determines how we experience it.

Some beliefs are impediments to well-being. For example, take our tendency to believe we are not enough. It is a common scourge. When we believe we are not enough, we react to our thoughts and events negatively. The belief has shaped our automatic interpretation of our thoughts and experiences. Our days are spent staving off the painful reactions that stem from the belief. The belief is a lens for seeing the world as a sad and painful place. 

Our beliefs shape our experience. So how do we change our beliefs? How do we program our minds? Most of us have beliefs that we want to change. We know that our lives would be better if we could see the world differently. I know I shouldn’t believe this, but how do I change my belief?

I describe here a method for changing a belief called Belief Aversion Training. It works like this. Our beliefs are rooted in emotion. We feel something is true or false. The mind is an association-making machine. With practice, you can learn to associate the feeling of disbelief with any idea. You can train your brain-based beliefs like you can train a computer-based model. 

I do not claim this method is the only way to change a belief. I also recognize it may have drawbacks. But it has some advantages and has worked well for me. It is just another tool that some may find helpful.

## Theory

We don’t believe what we know. Rather, we believe what we feel. I may rationally know that I am enough, but it is only when I feel that I am enough that I will react to experience as if I am enough. Rational logic is an important component of belief but emotion is the arbiter. In one [example study](Harris 2008), when subjects were presented with an idea they disbelieved, fMRI imaging showed activation in brain regions associated with disgust. If you want to change a belief about something, you must change what you feel about that something.

The brain is an association-making machine. It is neuroplastic, constantly making new associations as “neurons that wire together, fire together.” When neural pathways are simultaneously activated, they increase their connectivity. This applies as well to associating ideas with emotional reactions. With enough brute-force training, we can train a computer vision model to recognize an object and a human mind to disbelieve an idea.  

One last point. We seem to have an innate negativity bias. Fear, anger, and disgust seem to be stronger than their counterparts. They provide us with more leverage for prying loose an unwanted belief. 

## Instructions

Belief Aversion Training has the following steps. 

### Identify The Target Belief

Identify the belief you want to change. We’ll call this the target belief. We’ll use the belief “I love chocolate” as an example. 

### Identify A Related Disbelief

Identify an idea related to the target belief that you strongly disagree with. We’ll call this the disbelief. This part can be challenging. For me, the most effective way to find a disbelief is to ask myself, “What is something I definitely don’t believe about this issue?”. Continuing with the chocolate example, one potential disbelief is “I want to eat only chocolate and nothing else for all my meals.”  

### Practice

Practice thinking the disbelief, then watching your emotional reaction to the disbelief, then thinking the target belief. The idea is to simultaneously activate your brain’s disgust reaction and the target belief. Let’s call each set of thinking the disbelief, watching the reaction, and thinking the target belief as an epoch. Every day, close your eyes, count ten breaths, then practice the epochs for five minutes. Eventually, when the target belief arises in your day, you’ll find that your mind reacts with the disbelief response. You will no longer believe the target belief. 

When just beginning, it may be helpful to start each session by watching a preposterous disbelief, like “I’m riding on the back of an elephant right now.” It may help you familiarize yourself with the emotional reaction of disbelief. Then, transition to practicing the epochs.

### Monitor

It’s important to monitor your progress. This will help you stay motivated. 

First, keep track of the number of training sessions you’ve completed. For weakly-held target beliefs, you may find your target belief changes after a few daily practice sessions. For more strongly-held target beliefs, it may take a month of daily sessions to begin to notice the change.

Second, quantify your progress on a weekly basis. Create a few questions about your target belief and quiz yourself on a Likert scale.
